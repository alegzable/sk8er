A toy app to track your skating progress :)

Sample tricks are stored in a .json file and added to Local Storage on first run.
Click "+" on the "Tricks" page to add a trick to "My Tricks". This will allow tracking scores and practice days for this trick.

In order to run the app locally, run these commands:

    npm install
    npm start
